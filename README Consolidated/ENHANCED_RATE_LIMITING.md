# Enhanced Rate Limiting Strategy for Gemini API

## Current Issue
Your Gemini API is on the **Free Tier** with strict limits:
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: 15 RPM (Requests Per Minute)
- **10 requests per minute max** for sustainable usage

## Root Cause Analysis
Your previous 2-3 second delays were still too aggressive:
- 2-second delays = 30 requests per minute (2x over limit)
- 3-second delays = 20 requests per minute (still over limit)

## New Enhanced Rate Limiting

### 1. Email Generation (app.py)
```python
# OLD: time.sleep(2)  # Too fast!
# NEW: time.sleep(10) # 6 RPM - safely under 10 RPM limit
```

### 2. Skill Extraction (matchmaker.py)
```python
# OLD: time.sleep(3)  # Still too fast!
# NEW: time.sleep(15) # 4 RPM - very conservative for complex operations
```

### 3. Match Email Generation (matchmaker.py)
```python
# OLD: time.sleep(2)  # Too fast!
# NEW: time.sleep(12) # 5 RPM - safe for batch operations
```

## Testing Strategy

### Step 1: Small Scale Test
```bash
# Test with only 1-2 users first
python app.py
# Go to localhost:5000/outreach
# Test email generation with 2 users max
```

### Step 2: Monitor Terminal Output
Watch for:
- ✅ "Email generated successfully" (no rate limit errors)
- ❌ "429 You exceeded your current quota" (need longer delays)

### Step 3: Gradual Scale Up
- 2 users: 20 seconds total (10s per email)
- 5 users: 50 seconds total
- 10 users: 100 seconds total (1.67 minutes)

## Production Recommendations

### Option 1: Upgrade to Paid Tier
- **Tier 1**: Link billing account
- **Higher limits**: 1000+ RPM instead of 15 RPM
- **Cost**: Pay per API call (much faster processing)

### Option 2: Batch Processing
```python
# Process users in small batches with longer delays
def process_users_in_batches(users, batch_size=3):
    for i in range(0, len(users), batch_size):
        batch = users[i:i+batch_size]
        process_batch(batch)
        time.sleep(60)  # 1-minute break between batches
```

### Option 3: Queue System
- Store email generation requests in MongoDB
- Process queue slowly in background
- Show progress to users

## Current Status
✅ Enhanced rate limiting implemented:
- Email generation: 10-second delays
- Skill extraction: 15-second delays  
- Match emails: 12-second delays

## Next Steps
1. **Restart your app**: `python app.py`
2. **Test with 1-2 users only** first
3. **Monitor terminal** for successful generation
4. **Scale gradually** if working

## Emergency Fallback
If still hitting limits, increase delays to:
- Email: 20 seconds (3 RPM)
- Skills: 30 seconds (2 RPM)
- Matches: 25 seconds (2.4 RPM)
